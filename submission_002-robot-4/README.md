# Problem - Toy Robot

Split the command and control functionality from the way the robotâ€™s response is presented to the user.

### To Run

* `python3 robot.py`
* follow the input prompts to get the desired output

### To Test

* To run all the unittests: `python3 -m unittest tests/test_main.py`
* To run a specific step's unittest, e.g step *1*: `python3 -m unittest tests.test_main.MyTestCase.test_step1`
* _Note_: at the minimum, these (*unedited*) tests must succeed before you may submit the solution for review.
